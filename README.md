### Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!

Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game that's easy to play and fun for all ages. The game is simple: two players simultaneously throw one of three hand signals:

- **Rock**: a closed fist
- **Paper**: a flat hand with fingers together
- **Scissors**: a "V" shape made with the index and middle fingers

The winning hand beats the losing hand as follows:

- **Rock** beats **Scissors**: because rock can crush scissors
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**: because scissors can cut paper
- **Paper** beats **Rock**: because paper can cover rock

**If both players throw the same hand signal, the game is a **Tie**.**

Your goal is to win the game by throwing a hand signal that beats your opponent's hand signal. You'll play against the computer, and we'll keep track of the score.
